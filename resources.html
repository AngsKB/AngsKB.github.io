        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class='resources-info'>Cells are the smallest living units of an organism. They are the fundamental unit of life, composed of billions of molecules: DNA, RNA, proteins, glycans, lipids, and small molecules that have defined molecular properties and biological activities. Each cell is able to respond to its environment and to communicate with other cells to create tissues, organs, and whole organisms.</p>

        <h3 class='resources-subtitle'>Classification of Organisms</h3>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class='resources-info'> All living organisms are classified into groups based on very basic, shared characteristics. Organisms within each group are then further divided into smaller groups. These smaller groups are based on more detailed similarities within each larger group. This grouping system makes it easier for scientists to study certain groups of organisms. Characteristics such as appearance, reproduction, mobility, and functionality are just a few ways in which living organisms are grouped together. These specialized groups are collectively called the classification of living things.
            The classification of living things includes 7 levels:</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class='resources-info'>Atoms contain three sub-atomic particles called protons, neutrons and electrons. The protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus at the centre of the atom, while the electrons are arranged in shells around the nucleus.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class='resources-info'>All organic compounds, whether they are a solid, liquid or gas, contain carbon atoms. Organic chemistry looks at the structure, properties and reactions of such compounds. Since organic compounds often contain other elements in addition to carbon, such as oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur, organic compounds have a vast array of properties. Take a look at some examples of organic compounds and their structures to the right (hover your mouse over each to reveal its name).</p>
